## Blog Frontend Vue

This is a simple frontend made in Vue3 to work with the API provided in the [following url](https://github.com/Kionashi/blog-api)

The project is designed to work specifically with the local environment of the API, using as baseurl http://127.0.0.1:8000/ . So in order to use a different url that baseUrl must be changed on src/components/PostList.vue and src/components/PostForm.vue
